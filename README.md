# B9122

Welcome to the repository for the class B9122 (PhD) Computing for Business Research.

This course split into two sections after lecture 6 and assignment 3: the morning section comprised Finance and Economics students (MSFE); the afternoon section comprised Accounting and Fundamental Analysis (MSAFA) and Marketing students (MSM).

Here you can find all the material for the class (except for lecture slides, which are on Canvas or on a Google Drive):

- `1 admin` contains policies, the grading standards, guides for PyCharm and Gradescope, and the now-defunct system to mark attendance by email.

- `2 lectures` contains sample code and input data used in lectures (but NOT lecture slides)

- `3 assignments` contains assignments 1-5, with solutions

- `4 exams` contains the midterm and final exams, with solutions

The hidden folder `.images` contains images used in several places in the repository.

Please contact me if you have any questions.
