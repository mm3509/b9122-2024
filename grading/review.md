# Review of generative AI uses and code similarity

If you received an email about your submissions being flagged for possible use of generative AI or similarity to another student, this guide provides some clarity about the process.

Please bear in mind that receiving the email does not mean you did anything wrong. I am very strict on academic integrity, so if I have any doubt, I prefer to investigate the issue. In most cases, it will be a routine check due to some unlucky coincidence of two students solving the problem with the same non-trivial logic. During this process, I'll presume you are innocent unless I can prove otherwise. If you did nothing wrong, please rest assured that you will not bear any negative consequences (even though the process itself may be a bit unpleasant). In both cases, you can count on me to always do the right thing.

This is the process:

1. I will ask you to schedule a one-to-one meeting with me via [Calendly](https://calendly.com/mm3509-columbia/meeting-with-miguel);

1. I will show you the code that caused suspicion;

1. I will give you an opportunity to explain the situation, if you want to;

1. I will ask you to write the same code from scratch ("live coding"), so I can make an assessment.

In most cases, I won't have any doubts about your ability to solve the assignemnt and the issue will be cleared in a few days. I will communicate the result by email. This review process will not change my view of you or of your work.

In some cases, my assessment may still point to chance of wrongdoing. I will tell you my concerns and we'll have an open conversation and you will have a second opportunity to explain your situation.

If you did something wrong (but not terribly wrong), I will offer an arrangement, such as a penalty on your grade or extra work. If you accept, and assuming that my review with the other student with similar code points in the same direction, this arrangement will close the matter. You will receive a confirmation email.

If you don't accept, or if I have a strong suspicion of academic dishonesty, I will ask the Office of Student Affairs to conduct an investigation. This procedure is complicated, long, and heavy; therefore, I will only take this route as a last resort. You will have an opportunity to explain your situation to a panel of impartial representatives, who will also presume you are innocent until proven otherwise.

I hope that this guide provides clarity on this process. Please contact me if you have any questions.
