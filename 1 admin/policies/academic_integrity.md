# Academic integrity

This version: October 14th, 2024.

This guide contains my policy on academic integrity. You'll have to read and pledge to abide by this policy to gain access to assignments and exams.

I have a separate guide for generative AI.

Violating the guidelines in this document is forbidden, violates the [CBS Honor Code](https://students.business.columbia.edu/office-of-student-affairs/academic-advising-and-student-success/academic-integrity), and I will report suspected instances of plagiarism. Please contact me if you have any questions about this policy.

## You must not collaborate

You are **not allowed to collaborate** with colleagues, neither on individual assignments and on exams.

Explanation: Grades are an assessment of your learning and your effort. If you submit work that is not yours, this assessment is tampered. I want you to own every work you submit, so that every grade reflects your own work.

Group assignments are the exception: you can and should collaborate with your group colleagues on these assignments.

If you have difficulties, see below.

## You must not cheat

You are **not allowed to cheat**, neither on assignments nor on exams. Cheating includes, but is not limited to:

- asking a colleague for their solution

- asking someone else to solve the assignment for you

- posting the assignment on the internet and asking others to solve it

## You can copy-paste _some_ code

You are allowed to copy-paste code from the following sources:

- **My code from this course**: everything that is on Canvas and on GitHub is for you to use. This includes the slides, Jupyter notebooks, Python files from lectures, and the code for the assignments.

- **Your own code from this course**, e.g. previous assignments or exams.

- **Code from StackOverflow**, in the following scenario: you have an error, you search online, someone posted code that solves it, and you copy-paste that code into your submission. You are allowed to do this as long as you attribute the code to the writer; you should do this in a comment, else we may inspect it when checking code similarity.

## You can use "open-book" and "open-notes"

The assignments and exams are open-notes and open-book:

- You can use your own notes and all the material from this course;

- You can search online for tips, tutorials, for specific problems you have.

## Getting help when you are stuck

If you have difficulties, **you can ask for help the TAs and I**. We will not give you the solution outright, but if you show that you exerted effort, we can help you find the right path to it. And we will then publish that information on a Canvas Discussion, so everyone has access to it.

For **assignments**: between the five of us, we have 6 hours of Office Hours each week, which should be plenty to provide all the guidance.

For **exams**: I will be in the room to answer your questions.

## Assessment and penalties

I have zero tolerance in regards to academic integrity. We will severely deal with violations of academic integrity detailed in this document.

Some of our methods are:

- exam monitoring with Proctorio, which records your screen;

- automated code similarity to flag submissions that look similar;

- a one-on-one time with me to show me how you would write the solution from scratch;

- referral to the Office of Student Affairs for further investigation.

Even if somehow you escape detection on the assignments, violating academic integrity will be a recipe for disaster on the exams.

Don't try to outsmart me. If you cheat, the risks you are taking far exceed the benefits. Don't do it.
