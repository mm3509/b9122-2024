## Option for afternoon section

Students from the afternoon section have the option to take the in-person exam. They will have to abide by all the rules in the in-person exam. In addition, they must:

- tell me ahead of time so I give you an assigned seat;

- not leave until the end of the exam, under penalty of 10 points on the grade;

- decide by the end of exam day whether to use it or prefer the take-home to avoid duplicating grading work for the TAs.
