# In-person exam

This version: October 14th, 2024.

This guide contains my policy on the in-person exam. You'll have to read and pledge to abide by this policy to gain access to the in-person exam.

Violating the guidelines in this document is forbidden, violates the [CBS Honor Code](https://students.business.columbia.edu/office-of-student-affairs/academic-advising-and-student-success/academic-integrity), and I will report suspected instances. Please contact me if you have any questions about this policy.

## Before the exam

- Install Proctorio and test it with the Test Exam on Canvas.

- Read the new policies on academic integrity and generative AI.

## Before entering the exam room

- Bring a single computer with an internet connection and a charger.

- Leave your phone(s), your tablet(s), external screens and all electronic devices other the computer above at home or in your locker. The reason is that Proctorio only monitors one screen, so any other screens you use cannot be monitored.

- Check your place in the random seating arrangement, published two hours before the exam.

**Yes, you read that right. Do not bring your phone nor your tablet. I do not want to see any of these during the exam and will carry a penalty of 5 points (see below).**

## During the exam

- Ask us for help if you need it.

- Submit your solutions to Gradescope (not Canvas) before the deadline. Gradescope will close automatically at the deadline and we will not accept late submissions.

## Penalties

- 5 points if you do not take your random seat assignment

- 5 points if you use your phone, your tablet, or another electronic device during the assignment

- 100 points if you submit late.

If you did not install Proctorio ahead of time, any time you lose by setting it up on exam day will NOT be made up to you. The assignment submission will automatically close on the deadline.
